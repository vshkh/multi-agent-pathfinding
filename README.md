# Multi-Agent Pathfinding Simulator

A Python-based simulation and visualization tool that demonstrates multiple agents navigating a 2D grid using A\* search and conflict resolution. The agents move in real time with animated paths, avoiding collisions and navigating around obstacles.

## Features

- Multi-agent path planning with A\* and reservation-based conflict avoidance
- Real-time animation using Matplotlib
- Adjustable grid size, agent count, and obstacle density
- High-contrast visualization with unique agent trails and motion
